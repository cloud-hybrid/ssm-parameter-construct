 * Client Credentials

 * Creates a credential provider function that reads from a shared credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials and a shared
 * configuration file at ~/.aws/config.
 *
 * Both files are expected to be INI formatted with section names corresponding to
 * profiles.
 *
 * Sections in the credentials file are treated as profile names, whereas profile sections in the config file
 * must have the format of[profile profile-name], except for the default profile.
 *
 * @example
 * import { Credentials } from "credentials";
 * const credentials = await Credentials.initialize();
 * console.log(credentials);
